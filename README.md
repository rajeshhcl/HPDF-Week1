4.	Clone this GIT folder completely into your local system
5.	As per package.json, install all the libraries using command: npm install --save <modulename>. Example:  npm install ï¿½save express
6.	Step 5 may not be required as the subfolder node_modules in my package has all dependencies but just ensure integrity is maintained.
7.	Now read thru Dependencies and Detailed notes on tips to execute server.js.
8.	Once all set, execute the server.js using any of the below commands:
    a.	npm start (this needs the main program to be only named server.js unless you overwrite in package.json file (refer to npm documentation on how to update).
    b.	node server.js
9.	Once the server starts running, go to any browser (chrome, IE, etc...) and enter any of the below URL to verify the server has started running.
    a.	http://localhost:5000 (in case you have changed port, use that instead of 5000).
    b.	http://127.0.0.1:5000

10.	If step 9 works, then you can try any link mentioned in "Detailed notes" as per task required.
